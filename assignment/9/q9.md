Let's make sure you know how to use JSON. Sort this JSON array of objects by the value of the age field. In case of a tie, sort by the name field. Paste the resulting JSON below without any spaces or newlines.
```
[{"name":"Alice","age":72},{"name":"Bob","age":11},{"name":"Charlie","age":77},{"name":"David","age":14},{"name":"Emma","age":63},{"name":"Frank","age":77},{"name":"Grace","age":48},{"name":"Henry","age":42},{"name":"Ivy","age":99},{"name":"Jack","age":39},{"name":"Karen","age":73},{"name":"Liam","age":55},{"name":"Mary","age":22},{"name":"Nora","age":56},{"name":"Oscar","age":47},{"name":"Paul","age":78}]
